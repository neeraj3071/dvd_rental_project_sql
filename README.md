# DVD Rental Database Project

This repository contains the project files for the **DVD Rental Database** project, completed as part of the **CIS 556 Database Systems** course at the **University of Michigan â€“ Dearborn** in Fall 2024.

## Project Overview

The **DVD Rental Database** project aims to provide hands-on experience in designing, querying, and optimizing databases. This project utilizes the DVD Rental dataset to analyze and optimize query performance using PostgreSQL. 

Key components include:
- Conceptual design and implementation using Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling.
- Database schema creation and data population.
- Writing SQL queries for data analysis.
- Indexing and query performance optimization.

## Features and Objectives

1. **Database Design and ER Modeling**  
   - Identified entities, primary/foreign keys, and applied normalization.
   - Designed an ER diagram for the database schema.

2. **SQL Querying**  
   - Performed multi-table joins, data retrieval, and aggregation queries.

3. **Database Transactions**  
   - Implemented ACID transactions to ensure data consistency.

4. **Database Administration**  
   - Conducted data loading, backups, and user permission management.

5. **Performance Optimization**  
   - Utilized indexing and query tuning to improve query execution times.

## Dataset Details

The project uses the **DVD Rental Dataset**, which consists of 15 interconnected tables representing a DVD rental store's operations. The dataset includes:
- Actors, films, rentals, payments, inventory, customers, staff, and locations.

The dataset was preprocessed to ensure compatibility with SQL commands. Transformation details are available in the `clean.sql` file.

## Query Performance Analysis

Queries were tested under three conditions to evaluate performance:
1. **Without indexes:** Baseline performance.
2. **With basic indexes:** Simple indexes on commonly queried columns.
3. **With advanced indexes:** Compound indexes for optimized performance.

Detailed query plans and benchmarks are included in the project report.
